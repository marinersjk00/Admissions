# Admissions

This program will determine if a candidate is a good candidate for UCLA admissions. It can receive input from a .txt file (may need slight modification for personal use) or can receive user-submitted input to perform it's calculations. This program has no affiliation with UCLA and should not actually be used to determine one's qualifications as a prospective UCLA student.
